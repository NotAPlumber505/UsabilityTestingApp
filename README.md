# Usability Testing Tool

This is a usability testing tool built with Streamlit, designed for collecting and analyzing user data across various phases of a usability test. The tool allows you to track user progress, save responses to multiple questionnaires, and visualize task success rates, demographics, and user feedback.

## Features

- **Consent Form**: Users must agree to terms before proceeding with the test.
- **Demographic Questionnaire**: Collects basic demographic information such as name, age, occupation, and familiarity with similar tools.
- **Task Tracking**: Users select and perform tasks, while the app tracks task duration and success status.
- **Exit Questionnaire**: Collects user feedback about their experience and overall satisfaction with the usability test.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualizes task success rates and aggregated user data in charts.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Streamlit
- Pandas
- Plotly

To install the necessary dependencies, you can use the following:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/usabilitytestingapp.git
cd usabilitytestingapp
```

2. Install the required packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the app:
```
streamlit run app.py
```
4. Open your browser and navigate to ```http://localhost:8501``` to access the app.

## App Flow
The app is divided into several tabs, each corresponding to a phase of the usability test:
1. **Home**: Introduction and instructions for the usability test.
2. **Consent**: Users must read and agree to the consent form before continuing.
3. **Demographics**: Users fill out a short demographic questionnaire, including name, age, occupation, and familiarity with similar tools.
4. **Task**: Users select and perform a task. The app tracks the time taken for the task and whether the task was completed successfully.
5. **Exit Questionnaire**: After completing the task, users fill out a questionnaire about their experience, including satisfaction and difficulty ratings.
6. **Report**: A summary of all collected data, including consent, demographics, task performance, and exit feedback, is presented in an easy-to-read format with charts.

## Data Storage

User data is saved in CSV files, which are stored in the ```data``` folder:
- ```consent_data.csv```: Stores consent-related responses.
- ```demographic_data.csv```: Stores demographic information.
- ```task_data.csv```: Stores task-related data, including task success and duration.
- ```exit_data.csv```: Stores exit questionnaire responses.

## Visualizations
**Task Success Counts**: A bar chart showing the number of users who successfully completed each task.
**Task Success Rates**: A stacked bar chart showing the success rate for each task.
